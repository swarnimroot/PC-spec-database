## Session 5 — 2026-05-07 (implementation)

**Goal:** Stage 2 (Dell end-to-end slice) implementation + six follow-up decisions applied on top of the subagent's first pass.

**Outcome:** Stage 2 complete and verified. Live refresh against the Alienware Area-51 PDP succeeded end-to-end through the full pipeline: scrapers-lib fetch → Dell bridge → catalog auto-add → cross-tile merge → diff → write/queue. All six user-locked decisions are applied and reflected in code, docs, and tests. 58/58 tests pass (42 baseline + 16 new). Ready for Stage 3 (drop in `bridge/{hp,lenovo,asus}.py`).

### What was built / changed

- **Bridge layer.**
  - `bridge/types.py` — `CandidateProduct` gains a `year_was_inferred: bool` flag (Decision 1). Not stored in the DB; threads through to the runner so the queue type can be picked correctly.
  - `bridge/helpers.py` — added the static `GPU_TO_BOARD` map and `lookup_board(gpu_model)` (Decision 5). Vendor prefix stripping + case-insensitive matching baked in.
  - `bridge/dell.py` — `_build_boards` rewritten: groups GPUs in a tile by `lookup_board(...)` instead of emitting one MB# per array index. Unmapped GPUs surface with `label: null` and the GPU bundle marked `needs-review`. Sets `cand.year_was_inferred` from `derive_year`'s second return. (Decision 4 confirmed already correct — the adapter wattage fallback to "Dimensions & Weight" was already present.)
- **Ingest.**
  - `ingest/runner.py` — new `ingest_product(conn, candidates)` entry point that merges N candidates sharing one PK, then calls `ingest()` against the merged result (single transaction). Cross-tile merge unions the eight list-of-offerings columns by per-column identity keys (CPU model name, GPU label+name set, display res+panel+refresh+size, etc.). `boards` has its own special-case unioning that collapses same-label entries and dedupes their GPU lists. `IngestReport` gains a `year_inferred` counter; `_diff_scalar` checks `year_was_inferred` when the field is `vendor_full_name` and routes to the new `year_inferred` queue type instead of `low_confidence_extraction`.
  - `cli/refresh.py` — switched from per-snapshot `ingest()` to `ingest_product()` after grouping snapshots by PK. Per-product print line lists the contributing tiles.
- **Docs.**
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` — `review_queue.conflict_type` enum extended with `year_inferred`.
  - `DATA_MODEL.md` — new "GPU → Board mapping (static)" subsection documenting the table and the unmapped-GPU rule.
- **Tests.**
  - `tests/bridge/test_helpers.py` — six `lookup_board` cases (all three tiers, vendor-prefix stripping, case insensitivity, unmapped fallback to None).
  - `tests/bridge/test_dell.py` — three new cases: boards label coming from the static map (live snapshot), `year_was_inferred=True` set on live snapshots, two-GPU 'or' string in one tile collapsing into one MB1 entry. The synthetic test now asserts `boards[0]["label"]["value"] == "MB1"`.
  - `tests/ingest/test_runner.py` — six new cases: `year_inferred` routing for inferred-year candidates, the same shape with `year_was_inferred=False` still routes to `low_confidence_extraction`, cross-tile CPU union, cross-tile boards union with dedupe, needs-review offerings stay separate from verified ones, single-candidate fallthrough, mismatched-PK error.
- **Live verification.** Wiped `competitive.db`, re-ran `db-init`, re-ran the live `refresh` against the Alienware Area-51 URL. Three snapshots returned, merged into one product row, results below.
- **Late-day addition: `storage_max_gb`.** Storage section was asymmetric with Memory (Memory had `memory_max_gb` ceiling + slot info; Storage had only `storage_slots`). Added a `storage_max_gb` scalar column on `products` to mirror Memory's shape. Bridge extracts the maximum capacity from Dell's "Storage" spec (parses TB/GB tokens; 1 TB → 1000 GB, no silent unit conversion on raw GB). Cross-tile merge for this field uses `max()` rather than last-writer-wins — three live tiles publishing 1 TB / 2 TB / 2 TB merge to 2000 GB. Stage 6 ceiling-merge candidates list (`memory_max_gb`, `storage_max_gb`, `memory_speed_mts`) noted in `ingest/runner.py` next to `_CEILING_MERGE_SCALARS` as a forward-compat hook; only `storage_max_gb` uses the new path today. Schema, types, bridge, runner, DATA_MODEL.md, and tests updated; 61/61 tests pass; live smoke against Area-51 confirmed `storage_max_gb=2000` (verified) with queue counts unchanged (4 `new_chip_unverified` + 1 `year_inferred`).

### Implementation decisions resolved this session

- **Decision 1 — `year_inferred` queue type.** Implemented as a dedicated conflict_type. `CandidateProduct.year_was_inferred` flows from the Dell parser into the runner, which routes the `vendor_full_name` review row to `year_inferred` instead of the generic low-confidence bucket. The cell-level status on `vendor_full_name` stays `needs-review` as required.
- **Decision 2 — Alienware naming (no change).** Confirmed: `sub_brand = "Alienware"`, `series = "Area-51"`. Existing helper tests already assert this; live refresh produces the same.
- **Decision 3 — Cross-tile merge for option-list fields.** New `ingest_product` entry point unions all eight offerings columns by identity key. Scalars stay one-per-snapshot (first wins). Needs-review offerings are NOT collapsed with verified ones — they stay separate in the merged list. Single-tile callers can keep using plain `ingest()`.
- **Decision 4 — Adapter wattage source (no change).** Confirmed: `bridge/dell.py` already extracts adapter wattage from "Dimensions & Weight" when "Power Supply" is missing. Logic intact, no edit.
- **Decision 5 — Static GPU → board map.** `GPU_TO_BOARD` and `lookup_board` live in `bridge/helpers.py`. Dell parser groups GPUs by board label per tile; cross-tile merge collapses same-label boards across tiles. Unmapped GPUs route through the existing `low_confidence_extraction` queue (and `new_chip_unverified` via catalog auto-add) — no new queue type per the user's explicit "keep it simple" rule.
- **Decision 6 — N/A.** Resolved by Decision 1.

### Live re-verification (Alienware Area-51 AA18250)

Pre-state (before this session's changes, from prior smoke test):
- `value_disagreement: 4`, `low_confidence_extraction: 3`, `new_chip_unverified: 4`. Three boards entries (one per tile). Two of three were `MB2` from the per-tile counter, one was `MB1`. CPU offerings were not unioned.

Post-state (after Decisions 1–5):
- `value_disagreement: 0`, `low_confidence_extraction: 0`, `year_inferred: 1`, `new_chip_unverified: 4`.
- `boards`: ONE entry, `label: "MB1"`, `gpus: [RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5090]` — both GPUs unioned across tiles.
- `cpu_offerings`: 2 unique CPUs (`Core Ultra 9 290HX Plus`, `Core Ultra 9 275HX`).
- Catalog auto-add fired 4 times (2 CPUs + 2 GPUs), as expected.

**Note on the `year_inferred` count.** The user's expectation was `~3` (one per snapshot). Got `1`. That is the correct behavior under cross-tile merge: three tiles for one product collapse into a single ingest, so `vendor_full_name` is enqueued once. Three would have meant we were still doing per-snapshot writes, which Decision 3 explicitly moves us off.

### Course corrections worth remembering

- **The original Stage 2 subagent emitted "one board per tile, label = MB{idx+1}".** That choice surfaces here as a bug: three live tiles produced `MB1` / `MB2` / `MB3` with the same GPU on each, which is meaningless. The static-map fix (Decision 5) is the right shape, and it was also a re-ask — the user had already said in Session 1 that motherboards are 1:N with GPUs at a *power class*, and the per-tile counter quietly broke that. Lesson: when a "stage" subagent's output doesn't match an earlier locked decision, treat it as a regression, not a new design question.
- **`value_disagreement` was masking a category error.** The 4 pre-state value_disagreement rows weren't real conflicts; they were three Dell tiles each writing their own version of the same offerings list and the runner index-wise diffing. Decision 3 (cross-tile merge) made the category error vanish. The diff path itself is fine — the input to it just wasn't the right shape.
- **`year_inferred` is intentionally per-product, not per-snapshot.** Easy to mis-spec as "one entry per tile." The right semantic is: the *product*'s year is suspect. One row per product is the correct cardinality once cross-tile merge is in place.
- **No new queue type for unmapped GPUs.** The user explicitly rejected adding an `unmapped_gpu` queue type. The existing `low_confidence_extraction` plus `new_chip_unverified` paths cover the case without proliferating queue types. Worth remembering when Lenovo/HP add their own GPU lookups.
- **`ingest_product` vs `ingest`.** Both are kept. `ingest()` stays as the per-candidate primitive (used heavily by tests and by anything that genuinely has one snapshot). `ingest_product()` is the right entry point for the CLI and any future caller that wants atomic cross-tile semantics. Don't deprecate `ingest()` — it's the simplest thing that could possibly work.

### Where we left off (pickup pointers for next session)

- **Stage 3 — drop in `bridge/{hp,lenovo,asus}.py`.** The dispatcher routes by `snapshot.source`, so adding a new vendor parser is a single file plus a registry entry in `bridge/dispatcher.py`. No other code changes needed. HP's "line 0 = base / rest = optional" convention is already documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **`scrapers-lib` Acer/MSI Tier 2** — still upstream-deferred; not blocking.
- **Stage 4 — view layer + `inspect-product` CLI** comes after Stage 3.
- **Live competitive.db** — current state from this session's smoke test. Not gitignore'd; carries the verified Area-51 row plus 5 queue entries (4 catalog stubs + 1 year_inferred). Wipe before the next live refresh if you want a clean slate.

---

## Session 4 — 2026-05-07 (implementation)

**Goal:** Begin Stage 1 implementation per `TASKS.md` — foundation: repo bootstrap, schema, connection layer, provenance-bundle helpers, `db-init` CLI.

**Outcome:** Stage 1 complete. Empty DB initializes cleanly via `python -m competitive_database db-init`; helpers round-trip both scalar bundles and list-of-offerings bundles. 5/5 tests pass. Ready for Stage 2 (Dell end-to-end slice).

### What was built

- **`pyproject.toml`** — Python 3.12+, no runtime deps, `pytest>=8` as the only dev dep.
- **`.gitignore`** — excludes `competitive.db` (and `-shm`/`-wal`), `__pycache__`, virtualenvs, build artifacts.
- **Package skeleton** — only Stage 1 modules (`db/`, `cli/db_init.py`, `__main__.py`); `bridge/`, `ingest/`, `views/`, and other CLI modules deferred to Stage 2+.
- **`db/schema.sql`** — four tables (`cpu_catalog`, `gpu_catalog`, `products`, `review_queue`) + 10 indexes. `IF NOT EXISTS` throughout, so re-running is safe.
- **`db/connection.py`** — `connect()`, `transaction()` context manager, `apply_schema()`.
- **`db/helpers.py`** — three bundle factories (scraped / manual / vendor-doesn't-publish) + scalar read/write + offerings read/write. Single write gateway for the rest of the project.
- **`db-init` CLI** — wired through `competitive_database/__main__.py`; other subcommands are stubbed-out comments awaiting Stage 2.
- **`tests/db/test_roundtrip.py`** — 5 tests covering schema apply, scraped scalar bundle, manual scalar bundle, two-offering `display_offerings` list, and `None` returns for missing/unwritten cells.

### Implementation decisions resolved this session

- **Identity-field shape — Option A.** `products.model_code` (TEXT) and `products.year` (INTEGER) are plain columns forming the composite primary key. Every other identity field — `vendor_full_name`, `brand`, `sub_brand`, `series`, `status`, `segment` — keeps a JSON provenance bundle. The two PK columns are mechanically derived from the vendor full name, so the meaningful provenance still lives on `vendor_full_name`. User chose A after a plain-language framing of the alternatives (skip provenance on labels only / skip on all identity / duplicate the PK columns).
- **I/O fields split into separate scalar columns.** Instead of a single structured `usbc_thunderbolt: {count, version}` column, the schema uses `usbc_thunderbolt_count` and `usbc_thunderbolt_version` as separate scalar bundle columns. Same for `usbc_non_thunderbolt`, `usba`, `hdmi`. Keeps the "scalar bundle" pattern uniform across the table; avoids needing a third storage shape; makes "all laptops with TB5" trivial to filter.
- **Catalog row-level status.** `cpu_catalog` and `gpu_catalog` each carry a plain `catalog_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'needs-review'` column. Per-cell statuses still live inside the JSON bundles; `catalog_status` is the row-level state for stub-vs-vouched (per the catalog auto-add policy).
- **pytest version range left open (`>=8`).** No upper cap. Pytest is famously stable across major versions; capping is busywork on a solo project. (Currently resolves to pytest 9.0.3.)
- **Manual bundles keep `source_note: null` when unset.** Predictable shape across every manual cell, easier on future code (manual-edit CLI, view layer). Tradeoff (slightly larger storage when no note) is invisible in practice.

### Course corrections worth remembering

- **The user is non-technical — frame option questions in outcomes, not mechanics.** First Option A/B/C explanation leaned on the "primary key" word; user pushed back ("too technical"). Reframed in terms of "do you want the system to remember when/why you marked something discontinued" — that landed. Same lesson for the pytest-cap and bundle-shape questions: lead with the day-to-day impact, mechanics are an aside.
- **Delegate implementation to subagents to save context.** User asked explicitly. The general-purpose agent ran the full Stage 1 build + tests and returned a 250-word report. Continue this pattern for Stage 2+ (each stage is a clean self-contained delegation target).

### Where we left off (pickup pointers for next session)

- **Recommended next-session priority: Stage 2 — Dell end-to-end slice** per `TASKS.md`. Smallest path that proves the architecture: fetch one Dell product via `scrapers-lib` → parse via `bridge/dell.py` → write to DB via the helpers → read back. Deliverables: `bridge/types.py`, `bridge/helpers.py`, Dell test fixtures, `bridge/dell.py`, `bridge/dispatcher.py`, `ingest/catalog_resolve.py`, `ingest/runner.py`, `cli/refresh.py` + `__main__.py` wiring, live smoke test.
- **scrapers-lib will need to be installed/imported in Stage 2.** Decide install strategy (sibling-repo path install vs. PyPI vs. submodule) at the start of Stage 2.
- Stage 1 exit criterion: empty DB initialized; helpers round-trip both bundle shapes. **Met.**

---

## Session 3 — 2026-05-07

**Goal:** Outline `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Walk through the open design questions. Propose `TASKS.md`.

**Outcome:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `TASKS.md` written. Six design questions resolved (the original five plus a sixth — view layer — surfaced mid-session). View layer added as a first-class concern of the data layer, not deferred to UI.

### What we covered

**Six design decisions locked:**

- **Provenance shape — bundled JSON per cell.** Every cell stores `{value, source_url|source_note, captured_at|entered_at, scraper_id|entered_by, status}` together. List-of-offerings fields carry per-leaf bundles. Trade-off accepted: plain-SQL queries on values require SQLite JSON functions; mitigated by all reads going through helpers.
- **Bridge layer — one module per vendor.** Vendor structures (Dell flat regex, HP multi-line line-0-is-base, Lenovo hierarchical path keys, ASUS section-grouped) are too divergent for a unified parser. Per-vendor module + shared helpers.
- **Ingestion flow.** CLI command → scrapers-lib fetch → vendor parse → catalog stub auto-add → diff → write-or-queue. Single SQLite transaction per snapshot.
- **Catalog auto-add — stub only.** New CPU/GPU rows get `model + brand` + `status: needs-review`. No Intel ARK / NVIDIA chip-spec fetch in Phase 1; deferred.
- **Resolution + manual entry — CLI helpers from day one.** `resolve`, `manual-edit`, `find-empty`, `find-conflicts`. Future UI sits on top of the same helper functions.
- **View layer — separate `views/` module, first-class.** One render function per category. `inspect-product` CLI renders through views. UI later renders through the same views (string render now; structured-record render added when UI lands). Single source of truth for human-readable presentation.

**Phasing locked.** Data layer (full) → structured validation pass → UI (Phase 2). The view layer's specific value: validation surfaces what UI will eventually show, so visual-layer bugs surface during validation, not after UI is built.

**TASKS.md stages — seven stages:** foundation → Dell end-to-end → other vendor parsers → view layer + `inspect-product` → other CLI helpers → validation pass → polish. Each stage gates the next.

### Course corrections worth remembering

- **UI was missing from the original task plan.** User noticed only "admin UI" was tagged deferred — no UI surface in Phase 1 at all. Confirmed phasing intent: data layer first, validate via CLI + DB Browser, THEN UI. The user's reasoning ("UI on bad data papers over the bug") is the correct architectural justification. Don't apologize for the deferral; it's the right order.
- **View layer was almost missed as a concept.** The user surfaced it: `inspect-product` should show what the UI eventually shows (e.g., "DDR5 5600 MT/s, 2 slots, max 64 GB" instead of three raw rows). Architectural concern, not a CLI ergonomic concern. Result: views are now a first-class module, with a planned promotion path from string-render today to structured-record-render when UI lands. Same module, additional functions, no rewrite.
- **`scrapers-lib` audit memory was partially stale.** Live verification confirmed Tier 2 fetchers return `list[ProductSnapshot]` (not single — vendors expose multiple tiles/variants per page). Bridge handles fan-out. Snapshot carries `url`, `fetched_at`, `raw` blob; per-cell provenance is bridge's responsibility. HP coverage figure of "~12 fields" was a snapshot of an older state — current is 23–26 via async PDP merge.
- **Helpers are a discipline, not a convenience.** Resolution, manual entry, view rendering — all go through helper functions. The future UI calls those same functions. Bypassing the helpers (even for "small" cases) breaks the single-source-of-truth promise that makes UI cheap later.

### Open at end of session

- Stage-by-stage implementation. Stage 1 (foundation) is the natural starting point.
- `VIEWS.md` (or section appended to `ARCHITECTURE.md`) — non-obvious format choices documented as the views are written. Created during Stage 4.
- Acer / MSI parsers and catalog chip-spec auto-fetch remain deferred; not blocking.

### Where we left off (pickup pointers for next session)

- `README.md`, `PRD.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TASKS.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` are all updated and consistent.
- **Recommended next-session priority:** Stage 1 (foundation). Bootstrap the repo, write `db/schema.sql`, build the provenance-bundle read/write helpers in `db/helpers.py`. No more design discussion — straight to implementation. Unless the user wants to revisit a locked decision, the design is settled.
- Memory updated: architecture decisions saved as a project memory.

---

## Session 2 — 2026-05-06

**Goal:** Lock the DB engine; audit `scrapers-lib`; close outstanding policy on vendor coverage, bridge-layer location, and source scope.

**Outcome:** Engine locked (SQLite). `scrapers-lib` audited (architecture + Tier 2 output ground-truthed). Four new policies locked. Schema unchanged. Ready to outline `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### What we covered

**DB engine — locked: SQLite.**
- Reasoning: solo use, manual quarterly refresh, hundreds of products max — well within SQLite's lane. Zero setup, one file, DB Browser for SQLite for spreadsheet-style cell editing.
- Trade-off accepted: JSON-shaped fields edit as JSON text in dev tools; small admin UI is the eventual fix, deferred.
- Rejected: Supabase (cloud), Postgres-local (setup friction without offsetting benefit), MongoDB (weak SQL filters), Airtable/Notion (can't store nesting or per-cell provenance).

**`scrapers-lib` audit — done.** Two passes: architecture summary + Tier 2 ground-truth.
- Implemented in scrapers-lib: Tier 1 (Reddit, RSS, articles, YouTube, BestBuy API — *not relevant* to this DB), Tier 2 (Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS), Tier 3 (BestBuy, Amazon retailer — *not relevant*).
- Deferred upstream: Acer, MSI Tier 2 scrapers.
- Output shape: `ProductSnapshot` with `specs: dict[str, str]` — text per category. No structured sub-objects, no per-cell provenance, no catalog FKs. Bridge layer required.
- Per-vendor format observed at audit time: Dell formal / regex-friendly (~20 fields). HP gaming PDPs reach 20+ fields after a recent async-reliability update (audit's "12-only" figure was stale). Lenovo hierarchical 3-level path keys (40+ fields). ASUS semi-structured (~20 fields).
- HP convention: multi-line spec values where line 0 = configured default, rest = upgrade options. Bridge must preserve ordering — maps to `tier: base/optional`.
- Granularity differs: Dell/HP per-tile (3 SKUs/page), Lenovo/ASUS per model family. Reconciliation = bridge-layer responsibility.

**Policies locked this session:**
- **Vendor coverage rule.** Build for all 6 brands. Missing scraper coverage = empty rows for that brand. Not a project block.
- **Bridge-layer location.** All project-specific parsing and transformation lives in `competitive-database`. `scrapers-lib` is only extended when the change is universally useful.
- **Source scope.** Tier 2 manufacturer pages only. Tier 1 (mentions) and Tier 3 (retailer pages) ignored for this DB.
- **No pre-locked manual fields.** Every DATA_MODEL field is scrape-eligible. Scraper extracts what it can; whatever's empty is the manual surface at runtime. Avoids locking out future scraper improvements.

### Course corrections worth remembering

- **Local-only, not Supabase.** Supabase pitched (admin-UI ergonomics were the appeal); user rejected — "must be local to begin with." Future engine recommendations should default to local-first unless cloud is invited.
- **HP coverage mis-stated.** I quoted the audit's "HP ~12 categories" figure; user corrected — recent `scrapers-lib` async-reliability update lifts HP gaming PDPs to 20+. The audit was a snapshot of an older state. Don't re-cite specific coverage numbers without verifying current.
- **Don't pre-lock fields as "manual-only."** I proposed marking brightness/HDR/thermals as manual-only based on the audit's "structurally absent" finding. User pushed back: those are runtime states, not design-time decisions. The provenance + status flag system already handles "vendor doesn't publish." Pre-locking creates technical debt against future scraper improvements and conflates runtime state with schema labels.

### Open at end of session

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` not yet written. Bridge-layer design is the meatiest piece (cell-provenance shape: embedded JSON vs. sidecar table; vendor-keyed parsing modules; ingestion + review-queue mechanics).
- `TASKS.md` not yet written.
- `scrapers-lib` Acer/MSI Tier 2 — upstream deferral; track but don't block.

### Where we left off (pickup pointers for next session)

- README, DATA_MODEL, PRD, SESSION_LOG updated and consistent. Memory updated: SQLite engine, four new policies, two new feedback memories (`local_first`, `no_premanual_fields`).
- **Recommended next-session priority:** Outline `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Topics: SQLite schema (cell-provenance design choice — embedded JSON vs. sidecar table), bridge-layer module structure (per-vendor parsers + universal extractors), ingestion flow (manual button → scrapers-lib fetch → bridge parse → review queue or DB), review-queue mechanics, manual-entry surface for fields the scraper didn't fill.

---

## Session 1 — 2026-05-05 to 2026-05-06

**Goal:** Kickoff. Define the data layer for the competitive gaming-laptop spec database — scope, data model, policy, schema, initial docs.

**Outcome:** Schema-ready. Project docs `README.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md`, `PRD.md`, and `SESSION_LOG.md` created.

### What we covered

**Foundational scope (locked):**
- Six brands: Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS, Acer, MSI. US sites only. Gaming laptops only.
- Data layer first; UI / chatbot are explicitly separate later efforts.
- No SKU-level configurations, no pricing, no OS variants, no release dates, no color / finish options, no history layer (current state only).

**Data model — load-bearing decisions:**
- Row = product, identified by **(model code, year)**. Vendor full name scraped as-is and decomposed into brand / sub-brand / series / model code / year.
- Multi-option fields stored as **lists of offerings**, not fixed slots — correcting the original Excel's CPU 1/2/3 / Display 1/2 fixed-column pattern.
- Two **catalog tables**: CPU and GPU only. Other commodities store specs directly on the product.
- Catalogs populated **deterministically** from Intel ARK / AMD / NVIDIA spec pages (LLM-derivation rejected as unreliable).
- Catalog references by **model name string** as the foreign key.
- Unknown chips → **auto-add to the catalog with `needs-review`** status; scrape proceeds.
- **Motherboard variants are first-class entities** on the product. Each board carries TPP cap, GPU TGP cap, and a list of supported GPUs. Boards are 1:N with GPUs (one board supports multiple GPUs at a shared power class).

**Policy (locked):**
- Refresh = **manual button only**, ~quarterly cadence expected.
- **Per-cell provenance + status flag**, with separate shapes for scraped vs. manual cells.
- Scraped cells: `verified` / `needs-review` / `vendor-doesn't-publish`. Hard correctness bar — if extraction is uncertain, don't store; route to review queue.
- Manual cells: `vouched` (default) / `needs-review`. Self-check tool, not a multi-reviewer workflow.
- Conflicts route to a **review queue**, never silent overwrite, never silent manual-lock.

**Field walkthrough — all 16 categories locked.** Full schema is in `DATA_MODEL.md`. Categories: CPU, GPU + Power (boards), Display, Battery, Memory, Storage, Network, I/O, Adapter, Camera, Audio, Keyboard, Thermals, Dimensions, Weight, Design.

**Trade-offs explicitly accepted (named so future sessions can re-evaluate if they bite):**
- No per-CPU TDP variance tracked — single `cpu_tdp_max` per product.
- One `tgp_max` per board collapses per-GPU TGP variance within a single board.
- Display panels not catalog'd — vendors rarely publish panel models, so panels stored as spec bundles.
- `adapter_connector` is product-level, assuming uniform connector across adapter offerings.

### Course corrections worth remembering

These are moments where the user pushed back and the model was refined. Future sessions should remember:

- **CPU 1/2/3 as fixed slots → list of offerings.** User initially modeled CPUs as fixed columns. We surfaced the foot-guns (position is arbitrary; reorders look like data changes; queries become disjunctive over column variants) and switched to list-shaped storage. Display/visualization can still render as CPU 1/2/3 columns.
- **Motherboards are 1:N with GPUs, not 1:1.** Initial assumption was each board hosts a single GPU. User corrected: MB1 supports e.g. RTX 5070 Ti / 5080 / 5090 at one shared power class. The GPU + Power model was reshaped around this.
- **GPU TGP per (board, GPU) collapsed to per board.** Realistic per-GPU TGPs within a board (e.g., RTX 5090 at 175W vs RTX 5070 Ti at 140W on the same board) are NOT captured. Trade-off accepted in service of simplicity.
- **TASKS readiness — wrong direction.** Originally claimed `TASKS.md` was more ready than `PRD.md`. User correctly pointed out tasks flow FROM the PRD (what + why) and ARCHITECTURE (how). Right order: `SESSION_LOG` → `PRD` → `ARCHITECTURE` → `TASKS`.
- **DB engine implications for manual entry.** When proposing manual entry via JSON / CSV editing, user pushed back: we're building a real DB, so manual entry is a DB tooling decision (form UI / admin panel / GUI like DBeaver), not a file-editing operation. That makes it an architecture concern.

### Open at end of session

- **DB engine selection.** Recommended **PostgreSQL** (locally, then Supabase / Neon / AWS RDS for cloud). Not yet locked by the user.
- **`scrapers-lib` field coverage** — unknown until an audit pass.
- **Per-vendor publishability** — unknown until research across the six US vendor sites.

### Where we left off (pickup pointers for next session)

- `README.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md`, `PRD.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` — written and committed as source of truth.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `TASKS.md` — deferred. They depend on:
  1. DB engine choice locked.
  2. `scrapers-lib` audit complete.
- **Recommended next-session priorities, in order:**
  1. **Confirm DB engine + setup.** PostgreSQL recommended; Supabase suggested for non-technical setup with a built-in spreadsheet-style admin UI.
  2. **`scrapers-lib` audit** — Explore agent. Map current extractor coverage per vendor against the locked field list. Identifies gaps requiring new scrapers.
  3. **Per-vendor publishability research** — research agent across the six US vendor sites. Mark per field which vendors publish vs. require manual entry. Feeds the per-cell `vendor-doesn't-publish` status.
  4. Once 1–3 are done, write `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `TASKS.md`.

### Memory state

- `MEMORY.md` index lists three memories: user profile, project overview, data model decisions.
- `project_overview.md` carries scope and locked policy.
- `data_model_decisions.md` carries the full field-shape map and connective tissue.
- These memory files are **backups / pointers** — `README.md` and `DATA_MODEL.md` and `PRD.md` in this repo are the source of truth.
